## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ggajos/ot-clean.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ggajos/ot-clean)

## Motivation

If you are working on multiple projects you probably encounter fact that lots
of garbage is produced. In many cases `clean` target from maven, sbt or any
other build tool is not enough. This project want to target this issue. By simple
executing `ot-clean` you can get rid of all garbage.

## Usage

Unpack [latest release](https://github.com/ggajos/ot-clean/releases) and add it
to your `path`. You might want to read also [How to efficiently manage PATH variable in Windows](http://ggajos.com/environment-variables-management/).
[Have a look also at series of the blog posts](http://ggajos.com/ot-clean-cleanup-cleanall/).

### .clean.yml

You can create `.clean.yml` file and specify which files/dirs you would like to
delete. Similar to `.gitignore` concept but using well known `yml` file standard.

```
deletes:
 - target
 - subproject/target/logs
 - ../logs
```

#### Wildcards support

Under the hood .clean.yml is using [DirectoryScanner](https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-shared-utils/apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/utils/io/DirectoryScanner.html)
and is passing `deletes` list as inclusion pattern. You can specify paths with
wildcards, for example:

```
deletes:
 - *.log
 - subproject/**/logs.txt
 - ../logs
```

Since version 0.5 double quotes are **no longer needed**. [Navigate here if you
wondering why they were needed before](http://ggajos.com/ot-clean-yaml-alias-nodes/).

[DirectoryScanner](https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-shared-utils/apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/utils/io/DirectoryScanner.html)
is using quite specific pattern naming. If you want to delete files with specific
extension you have to use `"**\*.log"`, please read below for more examples:

> When a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the following special characters can be used:
> '*' matches zero or more characters
> '?' matches one character.
> 
> Examples:
>
>  * "**\*.class" matches all .class files/dirs in a directory tree.
>  * "test\a??.java" matches all files/dirs which start with an 'a', then two more characters and then ".java", in a directory called test.
>  * "**" matches everything in a directory tree.
>  * "**\test\**\XYZ*" matches all files/dirs which start with "XYZ" and where there is a parent directory called test (e.g. "abc\test\def\ghi\XYZ123").

#### Run

Go to directory you want to perform clean and type `ot-clean`. No worries,
by default it is going to display only information what could be cleaned up.
No data will be lost. In order to actually remove files you have to provide `-d`
argument:

```
ot-clean -d
```

#### Arguments

You can see list of all supported arguments for current version [here](https://github.com/ggajos/ot-clean/blob/master/src/main/resources/ot-clean/help.txt).

## Roadmap

### Versions

* ✓ 0.1 - Clean maven project in current directory without using maven
* ✓ 0.2 - Recurrence parameter `r`
* ✓ 0.3 - Add support to delete custom directories via .clean.yml
* ✓ 0.4 - Support wildcards
* ✓ 0.5 - Preprocess Yaml file so double quotes are no longer needed.
* ✓ 0.6 - Add summary about deleted files, dirs and empty total space.

### Backlog

* At the end of the scanning without `d` argument, ask user if he wants to delete those files.
* Add support for multiple base dirs (`from:` section)
* Add linux script
* Add exclude support
* Add support of default arguments
